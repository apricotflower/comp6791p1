How to run the code:
1.Run DeleteIndex.py to clean the files which generated before in the project.(If there is no files which generated before, just skip this step.)
2.Run Driver.py to generate the indexes by spimi algorithm and get the table of lossy dictionary compression techniques. Then you can also input the query after the table showing out.
3.After the index generating by step 2, you can run Query.py to load the dictionary which generated by step 2 to implement rudimentary information retrieval.
